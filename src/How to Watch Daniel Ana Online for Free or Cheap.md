Daniel & Ana is not a typical movie. It is based on a true story that happened in Mexico in 2005. The film does not shy away from showing the brutal reality of the kidnapping and the aftermath. It does not offer any easy answers or resolutions. It does not exploit the violence or the sexuality for sensationalism. It does not judge or moralize the characters or their actions. It simply presents the facts and lets the viewers decide how to feel and think about them.
 
The film is directed by Michel Franco, who also wrote the screenplay. He uses a minimalist style that relies on long takes, natural lighting, and ambient sound. He avoids any music or dramatic editing that could manipulate the emotions of the audience. He trusts the actors to convey the complex emotions of their characters without much dialogue or expression. He creates a realistic and immersive atmosphere that makes the viewers feel like they are witnessing the events as they unfold.
 
The film is led by two remarkable performances by Dario Yazbek Bernal and Marimar Vega, who play Daniel and Ana respectively. They are both young and talented actors who have appeared in other Mexican films and TV shows. They have a natural chemistry and rapport that makes their sibling relationship believable and relatable. They also show courage and vulnerability in portraying their characters' trauma and transformation. They deliver nuanced and authentic performances that stay with the viewers long after the film ends.
